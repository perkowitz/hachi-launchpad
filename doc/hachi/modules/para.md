# Overview

Para is a paraphonic grid-based sequencer. 
What is a "paraphonic" sequencer? 
A paraphonic synthesizer is one that has multiple oscillators but only one filter-amp path, meaning
that, though it can play chords. it can't play fully separated, individually articulated notes at the same time.
Similarly, this paraphonic sequencer allows multiple notes to be sequenced on each step, but they cannot
be completely controlled separately. Instead, it is programmed much like a monophonic sequencer; each
active step ends all the previously-played notes. A step can be a "tie", which means it will continue
notes played by a previous step. In essence, Para can play chords at each step, but cannot, for example,
sustain one note while a sequence of other notes play beneath it. This makes for a simplified 
interface that allows for easy creation of chord sequences.


Para can hold 16 sessions in memory at a time. 
Each session contains 16 patterns.
Each pattern consists of 16 steps. 
Each step can play multiple notes (with a single settable velocity), 
can tie the previous step, or can play  rest.
The entire contents of memory can be saved to a file. 
Within the Para module, 8 different files can be saved and loaded, but
the files can be copied, backed up, and shared. Data is saved in a JSON format.


# Layout and Controls

## Main View

### Standard Controls

- Mute: disables the MIDI output of the sequencer.
- Settings: toggles between the main view and the settings view.
- Save: saves the current memory contents to the current file.

### Patterns

Each session contains 16 patterns, which are selected using the pattern pads.
Tapping a pattern pad will switch to that pattern on the next measure. 
Multiple patterns can be chained by holding down the first pattern's pad
and then tapping the last pattern's pad. 

#### Edit Select and Copy

On the left group above Save, these controls can be used to select a pattern for editing
or copy a pattern to another pattern slot. 

When a pattern chain (or single pattern)is selected, the first pattern in the chain
will be selected for editing; all edits described below will apply to that pattern.
To select another pattern for editing, hold down the Edit Select element, and then
tap the pattern to edit. This pattern will remain selected until a new pattern
chain is selected, even while the current chain cycles through patterns.

To copy a pattern, hold down the copy button, tap the pattern to copy, and then
the desired destinaton. 

### Keyboard

These pads form a simple two-octave keyboard, starting from C on the left. These keys can be used
to select the notes for the currently selected step. 
The octave up and down buttons will change the octaves being played by the keyboard.
During playback, the notes being played will briefly flash. If the notes are above or below
the current keyboard range, the appropriate octave button will flash.

### Steps

Each pattern has 16 steps. A step can be selected for editing by tapping it. The keyboard
can then be used to toggle whether each note is played on that step. Holding down the 
step pad will cause the step's notes to be highlighted on the keyboard; if the notes
are out of range of the keyboard, the octave up or down pads will be highlighted. The
step pad doesn't have to be held down to edit the notes; it's just to display the selected
notes on the keyboard.
Note that if Para is in monophonic mode, hitting any key will toggle off any other key that was on. 

#### Step Edit Modes

The left two buttons on the bottom row choose either toggle mode or select mode for step
pads. In toggle mode, tapping a step pad will toggle it from enabled to disabled or vice
versa. In select mode, tapping a step pad will not change its enabled state. In either
case, tapping the step pad will select it for editing. 

#### Step Gate Modes

A step can be set to PLAY or TIE by tapping the corresponding element along the bottom.
When set to PLAY, the step will play the programmed notes.
In TIE, it will simply hold any previously-played notes but will not play its own. Note
that a REST can be created by disabling the step, or by setting it to PLAY with no
notes selected.

#### Control Edit Mode

Para allows up to eight MIDI controllers to be sequenced in each pattern. The controller numbers used
are set in the module config, and the values can be edited in element edit mode. Tapping the Control
mode button will put Para in element edit mode. Row 6 is used to select one of the 8 controllers, 
and rows 7 and 8 are used to edit the value at each step. Tap a element select button to select the controller,
tap a step button, and then tap a value button to set a value for that controller on that step. Tapping
the step buttons toggles them on and off. Each of the eight controllers can be set to active or 
inactive, by tapping the corresponding pad in row 5; inactive controllers can be edited, but no MIDI messages
will be sent.

 


#### Transpose Controls

Next to the upper octave of the keyboard are the transpose up and transpose down controls.
These will transpose all notes on the current step up or down an octave. Note that these
change the selected notes, while the octave up and down controls change the visible range
of the keyboard.

### Value Buttons and the Value Control

These buttons can be used to select from a range of values; the purpose varies depending on the context, as described
elsewhere in this manual. 
The eight value buttons represent eight values in the relevant numeric range, with the lowest value at the bottom and highest value at the top.
Hachi can also be configured to accept a MIDI controller (a specified controller number on a specified channel)as the value controller. 
When the value buttons are active, a value received for this MIDI controller will set that value as if a value button had been pressed.
Of course, the value controller has the full range of 128 values, instead of just eight with the buttons.


## Settings View

Para uses the standard [Settings Module](settings.md) for all settings.


# Configuration

Para has a configuration option for the file prefix, used
to specify filenames for saving data. Mono can also be
set to use a yellow, orange, blue, or pink color palette.
The ```monophonic``` setting can be true or false; when true, it will allow only one note
to be set on each pattern step (though it will not automatically alter previously-saved sequences
with multiple notes).
The ```sessionPrograms``` setting
can be used to set midi program change values for each session. When the session is loaded, a program change 
message will be sent with the provided value; a missing value or value of ```-1``` will result in no 
message being sent.
The ```controllers``` setting will specify the MIDI controller numbers assigned to each of the
eight programmable controllers available. 


```
  "modules": [
    {
      "class": "ParaModule",
      "filePrefix": "para0",
      "palette": "orange",
      "monophonic": false
    }
  ]
```

## Keyboard and Chords

If Hachi is configured with a MIDI keyboard (see [the main Hachi manual](../hachi.md)), ParaModule will respond to 
chords by filtering output MIDI notes to the closest Chord note.

# Color Palette

Para has four defined palettes: yellow, orange, blue, and pink. This section describes the color values in the default yellow palette.

- On most controls, dark gray indicates off/inactive, and bright yellow indicates on/active.
- Patterns are shown in dim yellow, with the playing pattern white and chained patterns gray.
- Disabled steps are off. Enabled PLAY steps are bright yellow, TIE steps dim yellow. The current step will flash white.
- The PLAY and TIE controls are respectively bright yellow and dim yellow.
- They keyboard is gray. Playing notes will flash yellow, as will the octave indicators. While editing a step, the step
notes will be blue.
- The octave up and down controls are white; the transpose up and down controls are dim yellow.
- Sessions are light blue, with the current session highlighted white.
- Load and save files are green and red respectively, with the current file white.
- MIDI channel is blue, with the selected channel white.
